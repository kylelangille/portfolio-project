# Kyle Langille's Portfolio

## About

This website was built using React and JavaScript as a project for Concordia's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. It is hosted on Netlify at [kylelangille.com](https://kylelangille.com).

The criteria for the project as defined by Concordia were such that the portfolio contain a "hero" section, an "about me" section, a project showcase, and a functioning "contact" section. Additionally, the portfolio must be responsive and viewable on all modern devices.

## Additional Features

- Smooth scrolling effect through the navigation bar
- Dark/light mode toggle
- CSS animations:
  - A typing animation on the heading in the hero section
  - The image in the hero section "follows" the cursor
- A "super secret" Easter egg (HINT: click the Hero image repeatedly)

## Design and Thought Process

- I wanted a minimalist but sharp design. I wanted to avoid the portfolio looking bland, while also ensuring that the design was not "cluttered" or too "busy". This approach applied to both the colour scheme and the overall layout.
- I wanted a scrollable page with minimal to no routing.
- I wanted the project showcase to be informative, but also incredibly minimal in keeping with the overall design.

- For the colour scheme, I leaned on [RealTimeColors](https://realtimecolors.com/). This is an incredibly helpful tool that enables the user to workshop colour schemes by applying the colours to a mock-up website.
- To implement the dark/light mode toggler, I drew heavily from [this article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/04/dark-mode-react-apps-styled-components/) from Blessing Krofegha.
- I intend to continue using this portfolio as I move into the industry, so I purchased the [kylelangille.com](https://kylelangille.com) domain from [PorkBun](https://porkbun.com) and rerouted the deployed site on Netlify accordingly.

## Future Plans

- Minimalism is (mostly) easy, but making a minimalist yet aesthetically engaging design is profoundly more challenging. I would like to add some more "flair" to the individual sections while still embracing the minimalist approach of the overall design. Once I know what that looks like for this project, I'll let you know ðŸ˜„.
- I intend to break my soft "no routing" rule to implement a page for my CV that is a viewable and downloadable .PDF file.
- Adding more robust projects that better showcase my abilities.
  - Currently, all of the showcased projects were originally built before enrolling in the Concordia Bootcamp. While I am still proud of them (to some extent...) I have grown more as a developer since building them, and as such they do not fully demonstrate my abilities as a developer.
